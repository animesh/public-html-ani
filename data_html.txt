" O Govinda, of what avail to us are a kingdom,
happiness or even life itself when all those for
whom we may desire them are now arrayed on this
battlefield? O Madhusūdana, when teachers,
fathers, sons, grandfathers, maternal uncles,
fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law and
other relatives are ready to give up their lives
and properties and are standing before me, why
should I wish to kill them, even though they
might otherwise kill me? O maintainer of all
living entities, I am not prepared to fight with
them even in exchange for the three worlds, let
alone this earth. What pleasure will we derive
from killing the sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra?"
