" The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: O son
of Pāṇḍu, he who does not hate illumination,
attachment and delusion when they are present or
long for them when they disappear; who is
unwavering and undisturbed through all these
reactions of the material qualities, remaining
neutral and transcendental, knowing that the
modes alone are active; who is situated in the
self and regards alike happiness and distress;
who looks upon a lump of earth, a stone and a
piece of gold with an equal eye; who is equal
toward the desirable and the undesirable; who is
steady, situated equally well in praise and
blame, honor and dishonor; who treats alike both
friend and enemy; and who has renounced all
material activities – such a person is said to
have transcended the modes of nature."
