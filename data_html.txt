" You are the father of this complete cosmic
manifestation, of the moving and the nonmoving.
You are its worshipable chief, the supreme
spiritual master. No one is greater than You, nor
can anyone be one with You. How then could there
be anyone greater than You within the three
worlds, O Lord of immeasurable power?"
