" Still others, who are inclined to the process
of breath restraint to remain in trance, practice
by offering the movement of the outgoing breath
into the incoming, and the incoming breath into
the outgoing, and thus at last remain in trance,
stopping all breathing. Others, curtailing the
eating process, offer the outgoing breath into
itself as a sacrifice."
