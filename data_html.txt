" One who is equal to friends and enemies, who is
equipoised in honor and dishonor, heat and cold,
happiness and distress, fame and infamy, who is
always free from contaminating association,
always silent and satisfied with anything, who
doesn’t care for any residence, who is fixed in
knowledge and who is engaged in devotional
service – such a person is very dear to Me."
