" One should meditate upon the Supreme Person as
the one who knows everything, as He who is the
oldest, who is the controller, who is smaller
than the smallest, who is the maintainer of
everything, who is beyond all material
conception, who is inconceivable, and who is
always a person. He is luminous like the sun, and
He is transcendental, beyond this material
nature."
