<h2 class="bg-title ec-ssa">English Commentary  - Swami Sivananda </h2>
<p class="bg-desc ec-ssa">12.1 एवम् thus? सततयुक्ताः ever steadfast? ये who? भक्ताः devotees? त्वाम् Thee? पर्युपासते worship? ये who? च and? अपि also? अक्षरम् the imperishable? अव्यक्तम् the unmanifested? तेषाम् of them? के who?  योगवित्तमाः better versed in Yoga.Commentary The twelfth discourse goes to prove that Bhakti Yoga or the Yoga of devotion is much easier than Jnana Yoga or the Yoga of knowledge. In Bhakti Yoga the devotee establishes a near and dear relationship with the Lord. He cultivates slowly and one of the five Bhavas (attitudes) according to his temperament? taste and capacity. The five attitudes are the Santa Bhava (the attitutde of peaceful adoration) Dasya Bhava (the attitude of servant towards the master) Sakhya Bhava (the attitude of a friend) Vatsalya Bhava (the attitude of a parent to the child) and Madhurya Bhava (the attitutde of the lover towards the beloved). The devotee adopts these attitudes towards the Lord. The last (Madhurya Bhava) is the culmination of devotion. It is merging or absorption in the Lord.The devotee adores the Lord. He constantly remembers Him (Smarana). He sings His Name (Kirtana). He speaks of His glories. He repeats His Name. He chants His Mantra (Japa). He prays and prostrates himself. He hears His Lilas (divine plays). He does total? ungrudging and unconditional selfsurrender? obtains His grace? hols communion wih? and eventually gets absorbed in Him.The devotee begins by worshipping the idols or the symbols of God. Then he performs internal worship of the Form. Ultimately he is led to the supreme worship of the allpervading Brahman (Para Puja).Thus As declared in the last verse of the previous chapter.Avyaktam The unmanifested? i.e.? incomprehensible to the senses? transcending all limiting adjuncts. The unmanifested Brahman is beyond all limitations. That which is visible to the senses is called Vyakta or manifest.The hearts of the devotees are wholly fixed on Thee. They worship Thee with all their heart and soul.There are others who worship the unmanifested Brahman which is beyond time? space and causation? which is attributeless? which is eternal and indefinable? which is beyond the reach of speech and mind. These are the wise sages.Of these two? the devotees and the men of knowledge -- who are the better knowers of Yoga (Cf.XI.55)	</p>

<p class="bg-desc scet-sga ">12.1 The subject-matter stated in the immediately preceding verse, ৷৷.he who works for Me, etc. is referred to by the word evam (thus).
Ye bhaktah, those devotees who, seeking no other refuge; evam, thus; satata-yuktah, being ever-devoted, i.e., remaining unceasingly engaged in the works of the Lord, etc., intent on the aforesaid purpose; paryupasate, meditate; tvam, on You, in the Cosmic form as revealed earlier; ye ca api, and those others, again, who have renounced all desires, who have given up all actions; who meditate on Brahman as described (below), aksaram, on the Immutable; avyaktam, on the Unmanifested, which is so on account of being bereft of all limiting adjuncts, (and) which is beyond the comprehension of the organs-in the world, whatever comes within the range of the organs is said to be manifest, for the root anj conveys that sense; but this Immutable is the opposite of that and is endowed with alifications that are spoken of by the great ones; those again, who meditate on that-; tesam, of them, among the two (groups); ke, who; are the yoga-vit-tamah, best experiencers of yoga, i.e., who are those that are surpassingly versed in yoga?
But leave alone those who meditate on the Immutable, who are fully enlightened and are free from desires. Whatever has to be said with regard to them, we shall say later on. As for those others-	</p>



<h2 class="bg-title scet-dss ">English Translation of Commentary  - Dr. S. Sankaranarayan </h2>
<p class="bg-desc scet-dss ">12.1 Evam etc.  The estion is for getting an explanation regarding the superiority  among those who are the worshippers of the Absolute with Sovereign power,  by the said method and those who worship the Self alone  [without any attribute].	</p>


<h2 class="bg-title scet-ssa ">English Translation of Ramanuja's Sanskrit Commentary</h2>
<p class="bg-desc scet-ssa ">12.1 Arjuna said  These are two types of spiritual aspirants who are contrasted thus:  (1) 

On the one hand there are those devotees who adore You thus; namely, in the way taught in such text as Whosoever works for Me (11.55), and who are  desirous of being ever integrated with You, namely, considering You as the supreme end. They adore You in utter devotion - You, the ocean of boundless attributes of limitless excellence like grace, affability, omniscience, true resolve etc., and endowed with all glory. (2) On the other hand there are those who meditate on the Imperishable, (Aksara) namely, the individual self in Its true nature, which is the same as the Unmanifest (Avyakta), namely that whose nature cannot be grasped by organs such as the eye etc. The estion posed is:  Which of these two classes of devotees have greater knowledge of Yoga?  Who would reach their respective goals sooner?  Such is the meaning of the estion. Sri Krsna clearly states later on, O Arjuna, I become before long their redeemer from the fatal sea of recurring births and deaths (12.7), with reference to the speed with which the latter kind of devotees reach Him.	</p>



<h2 class="bg-title chakravarthi">Commentary  - Chakravarthi Ji</h2>
<p class="bg-desc chakravarthi">In the twelfth chapter, the superiority of all types of devotees to the jnanis is described, and among the devotees those who are endowed with wonderful qualities like lack of hatred are praised. Arjuna heard the great superiority of bhakti at the beginning of the topic of bhakti in the following words:
yoginam api sarvesam mad-gatenantar-atmana sraddhavan bhajate yo mam sa me yuktatamo matah
But I consider he who worships me with faith, with mind attached to me, to be greater than all types of yogis. BG 6.47
Arjuna, desiring to hear about the superiority of bhakti, even if it is in summary, asks a question. Between the devotees described as being constantly engaged, who worship you as Syamasundara, mentioned at the end of the last chapter with – mat-karma krn mat-paramah (BG  11.55),   and   those   who   worship   the impersonal, unqualified aksara brahman described in the srutis with statements such as etad vai tad aksaram gargi brahmana abhivadanty asthulam ananv ahrasvam (Brhad Aranyaka Upanisad 3.8.9) (O Gargi, that aksara, which is not wide, not small and not short, is called brahman), among these two types of persons who know yoga, who are the best knowers of yoga (yoga vittamah)? Who know the best process for attaining you? Or, do they not know? In a comparison of two items usually the form yoga vittara (which of them know yoga better) would be used. The word yoga vittama should be understood to suggest that among the many very good knowers of yoga (yoga vittara), who are the best knowers of yoga (yoga vittama)?	</p>



<h2 class="bg-title rudra">Rudra Vaishnava Sampradaya - Commentary </h2>
<p class="bg-desc rudra">
The twelfth chapter conclusively  determines  which  of  the  following  two
paths is superior. The worship of the abstract impersonal  and  imperishable
brahman  which  is  the  spritual  substratum  pervading  all  existence  or
personal devotion to the Supreme Lord Krishna in  His  original,  two  armed
form with personality,  qualities  and  attributes.  At  the  conclusion  of
chapter eleven Lord Krishna declared  that  one  who  performs  all  actions
dedicated to Him and has only Him as the  ultimate  goal  being  exclusively
devoted to Him attains Him. In various verses such as chapter  9,  verse  31
Lord Krishna has ordered Arjuna with  kaunteya  pratijanihi  na  me  bhaktah
pranasyati  which  means  declare  it  boldly  that  My  devotee  is   never
vanquished. This shows the inherent superiority  of  the  devotees  of  Lord
Krishna. Similarly the superiority of one who is devoted  to  knowledge  has
been given in chapter 7, verse 17 with tesam jnani  nitya-yukty  eka-bhaktir
meaning  one  in  knowledge  of  exclusive  loving  devotion  is  always  in
communion with Him. Such men of knowledge excel all  others.  Thus  although
both paths are exemplary Arjuna is requesting  to  know  which  of  the  two
paths is superior being better  suited  for  yoga  or  the  science  of  the
individual   consciousness   attaining   communion   with    the    ultimate
consciousness.	</p>


<h2 class="bg-title brahma">Brahma Vaishnava Sampradaya - Commentary </h2>
<p class="bg-desc brahma">
Hari OM! This  chapter  confirms  that  propitiation  to  the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna is superior to the unmanifest, impersonal and  imperishable  brahman
or the spiritual substratum  pervading  all  existence.  Here  Lord  Krishna
outlines the procedure of performing it. The procedure  itself  becomes  the
means for moksa or liberation from material existence.  All  who  propitiate
the  brahman  will  also  achieve  moksa  after  having  all  their  desires
fulfilled. In the Agni section of the  Sama  Veda  it  states:  Propitiating
that which  is  superior  to  the  eternal  and  beginningless  brahman  one
achieves moksa from samsara or the endless cycle of  birth  and  death.  The
words aksaram avyaktam  refer  to  the  indestructible,  unmanifest  supreme
absolute or brahman whose steadfast worship  eventually  releases  one  from
all constraints. So great is the result  of  propitiation  in  reference  to
this as revealed in the Vedas. Those who  worship  the  goddess  Sri  Laksmi
with four arms and hands, ever  young,  ever  content,  resplendent  as  the
eternal consort of the Supreme Lord in the spiritual worlds being His  sakti
or spiritual feminine potency in  the  material  worlds,  endowed  with  the
wealth of wisdom; such a being is  blessed  by  the  two-fold  form  of  the
Supreme Lord which manifest themselves both externally as an experience  and
internally within ones heart.

This has been documented in other Vedic scriptures as well in  the  Puranas.
Having started with the declaration in Rig  Veda  X.CXXV  that:  Sri  Laksmi
wanders wherever the different vibhuti or  divine,  transcendental  opulence
of the Supreme Lord appear such as the Rudras, the Vasus, the  Adityas,  the
Visva-devas etc. She is the gatherer of treasures and the  empress  of  Lord
Krishnas direct expansion Narayana the Lord of all Vaikuntha,  the  eternal
spiritual worlds and being the personal sakti of the Supreme Lord  she  also
expands herself as the consort of each and every incarnation  and  expansion
of Lord Krishna and  thus  also  merits  worship.   Thus  the  demigods  and
elevated beings have established her worship in many  places  and  homes  to
abide in, on the left side of the Supreme Lord. Through her  alone  all  eat
the food that feeds them as well as sees, breathes and hears  the  sound  of
the word outspoken, although they know it not and are unaware. Hear now  one
and all the truth as she declared it:  The  one  who  she  benedicts  excels
above others and is most powerful  becoming a sage, yogi or brahmana. It  is
by her energy that the bow of Rudra is bent and his arrows are propelled  to
strike and slay those who disrespect, despise and  offend  the  devotees  of
the Supreme Lord. On the worlds summits she  designates  the  powerful.  Her
home is in the waters of the casual  ocean  far,  far  beyond  the  material
worlds and far beyond even the heavenly planets. Sri  Laksmi  the  universal
mother is majestic in her grandeur. One who pleases her is blest  to  become
a Brahmin, opulent and wise. Because the Vedic scriptures  state  like  this
there may be some doubt as to whether Sri Laksmi has the capacity to   grant
moksa or liberation by the power  of  the  Supreme  Lord.  To  discern  this
subtle truth and for the  sake  of  knowledge  Arjuna  uses  the  word  evam
meaning in which way.

Arjuna is requesting reassurance since  experiencing  the  reality  of  Lord
Krishnas visvarupa or divine universal form, he was puzzled and  unsure  if
avaktya  or  the  unmanifest  being  the  brahman  or  spiritual  substratum
pervading all existence should be meditated on  or  should  he  meditate  on
prakriti the material substratum underlying physical existence which is  the
source of the three  gunas  or  modes  of  material  nature  being  tama  or
ignorance, raja guna or mode of passion and sattva guna or mode of  goodness
The word aksaram means eternal, absolute and Sri Laksmi is also eternal  and
absolute and prakriti arises completely out of her but the Supreme  Lord  is
superior to all that. Then he is wondering should he not  worship  the  atma
or eternal soul within or should he just directly worship the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna with  loving  devotion?  The  indestructible  brahman  is  a  direct
reflection of the  Supreme  Lord  and  none  other  then  He.  Always  being
blissful He appears as Vasudeva and is all pervading. He is  also  paramatma
the Supreme Soul within the etheric heart of all sentient beings.  This  has
been given in chapter two.  His  form  and  qualities  have  been  given  in
chapter  three  and  meditation  has  subsequently  been  advised   as   the
consequent activity.

Knowledge of  the  prodigious  manifold  forms  of  the  Supreme  Lord,  His
manifold expansions, His manifold  incarnations,  His  visvarupa  or  divine
universal form and the unlimited lilas or pastimes of them  all  begins  the
revelation that Lord Krishna is the immortal, eternal  Lord  of  all  lords,
from whom everything emanates in existence and  to  whom  all  paths  return
back to Him. In the Sama Veda, Saukarayana section we find  that  Rudra  the
mind born son of Brahma approaches him and asks to know who  is  verily  the
ultimate goal of all existence, the eternally established,  creator  of  all
beings who bestows moksa or liberation upon  the  aspirants,  the  righteous
and the noble. How does one meditate upon such a Supreme Being and  how  can
one meditate upon a Supreme Being who is completely  spiritual  without  any
material qualities or attributes? Brahma replied it is  verily  the  Supreme
Lord Krishna who is the ultimate goal as well as the  object  of  meditation
by the  aspirants  and  the  granter  of  moksa.  Of  unlimited  avatars  or
incarnations, expansions  and  manifestations,  appearing  in  many  colours
surrounded by a golden hue. He verily is shining like the sun and should  be
meditated upon within the heart as a  personality  resembling  a  human  the
colour of a radiant dark blue sapphire with gentle smile  and  hands  giving
blessing surrounded by a golden hue. He is camouflaged by  the  brahman  the
spiritual  substratum  pervading  all  existence  and  which   emanates   an
impenetrable  dazzling  light  throughout  all  creation  which  effectively
covers His all pervading form. It  is  for  this  reason  that  He  is  also
propitiates as avyaktam or immutable and aksaram or  unmanifest  because  He
cannot be perceived by material vision.

Now begins the summation.

Hari OM! Here is explained the means of achieving spiritual practice.

The immutable, unmanifest known as the brahman although without form by  the
will of the Supreme Lord  arises  from  His  sakti  or  spiritual,  feminine
potency known as Sri or Laksmi. For her propitiation an aspirant must  leave
home and for being initiated in tattva  or  knowledge  about  her  one  must
approach and accept a spiritual master in her  line.  Whomsoever  learns  to
propitiate her attains moksa. Thus the objective of both  the  aspirant  and
the guru are fulfilled. Those who propitiate Sri Laksmi, the consort of  the
Supreme Lord is His sakti which controls the material existence and is  also
known as Ambika, Agrya, Aupala, Hri and Sivdya are granted   moksa,  If  Sri
Laksm is pleased then the Supreme Lord becomes pleased  also and if  she  is
not pleased then the Supreme Lord remains unpleased as well.

The Brahmanda Prurana states: Sri Laksmi is known as avyaktam or  unmanifest
because prakriti or the material substratum  underlying  physical  existence
arises from her. She is also known as  aksaram  or  immutable,  the  Supreme
consciousness, the primal source, the refuge for all and  the  abiding  one;
but the Supreme Lord who empowers her is verily superior  to  her.  So  such
propitiation to the avaktam is synonymous with propitiation  to  Sri  Laksmi
and the Supreme Lord. This has been asked by  Arjuna  for  clarification  of
which path is more meritorious for attaining moksa. That  which  is  abiding
within is known as  the  immutable  and  never  changing.  This  is  clearly
determined by such statements in the Vedic scriptures such  as:  That  which
who abides within, eternally, unlimited, all pervading,  etc.  These  things
clearly refer to  the  unmanifest  consciousness.  Otherwise  such  distinct
queries such as who is to be propitiated and the method of propitiating  Him
and between the two which is superior would not have been asked.  Those  who
consider  propitiation  to  the   abstract,   indistinct,   impersonal   and
imperishable brahman to be superior  to  direct  loving  devotion  unto  the
Supreme Lord are verily deluded and far  away  from  the  actual  tattva  or
conclusive truth.	</p>


<h2 class="bg-title shri">Shri Vaishnava Sampradaya - Commentary </h2>
<p class="bg-desc shri">
In the previous chapter the Supreme  Lord  Krishna,  the  possessor  of  all
divine attributes as well as countless exalted qualities such  as  an  ocean
of mercy, compassion, affability, omniscience etc. and  the  source  of  all
avatars or  incarnations  and  expansions,  being  the  ultimate  object  of
worship to all who aspire  for  the  path  of  bhakti  or  exclusive  loving
devotion unto the Supreme Lord Krishna;  revealed  His  unlimited  sovereign
power of  universal  dominion  in  the  form  of  His  visvarupa  or  divine
universal form after being requested by His  devotee  Arjuna.  It  has  also
been established that uninterrupted profound, sublime bhakti  alone  without
cessation is the only possible way  to  realise  the  Supreme  Lord  in  His
ultimate nature and experience communion with Him. Now in this  chapter  the
following three realities will be examined.
1) The inherent superiority  of  an  aspirant  performing  bhakti  involving
meditation  directly  upon  the  Supreme  Lord  Himself  as  compared  to
meditation upon the atma or the eternal soul which  only  leads  to  atma
tattva or realisation of the soul in order to attain the ultimate goal of
all existence. This  superiority  of  bhakti  is  measured  in  terms  of
absolute fulfilment of the ultimate goal and in the sublime felicity  and
bliss of performance. Bhakti or love  of  God  is  considered  the  fifth
purusharthas above the other four ambitions of humans beings which are 1.
Dharma or righteousness which consists  of  two  parts  first  being  the
regular performance of Vedic activities and the second  being  performing
actions which benefit all living entities such as freely providing  fresh
water and salt to all and  protecting  against  all  demoniac  influences
whenever they appear. 2. Artha or the  righteous  acquirement  of  wealth
according to the Vedic scriptures without usury or deception. 3. Kama  or
enjoyment and pleasure in the  material  existence  following  the  Vedic
scriptures without perversion or degradation. 4. Moksa or liberation from
material existence by atma tattva or liberation from  material  existence
by bhakti realising the Supreme Lord direct. It should be noted that atma
tattva is automatically an inherent part of bhakti and thus those blessed
living entities who perform bhakti to the Supreme Lord Krishna or any  of
His authorised avatars do not have to make any separate or special effort
to achieve this.
2) The method of realising the Supreme Lord will be given in verse two.
3) The aksaram or abstract, impersonal unmanifest path  examined  in  verses
3,4,5 is applicable  for  those  who  are  inept  and  unqualified.  This
ineptitude and lack of qualification is due  to  the  absence  of  humbly
approaching a spiritual master from one of the four  authorised  Vaisnava
sampradayas or empowerd lines of disciplic succession  and  after  being
accepted by him and initiated being taught the fundamentals of bhakti.

The superiority of bhakti or exclusive loving devotion to the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna is made manifest by the superiority of He, Himself being the  object
of such loving devotion. This maxim of superiority  was  briefly  stated  by
Lord Krishna in chapter six verse 47 where  He  states  :  Those  with  firm
faith in the Vedic scriptures describing  super-excellent  devotion  to  Him
and with hearts  full  of  love  dedicate  all  their  actions  to  Him  are
yuktatamah the most superior of all.

The words satata-yuktah meaning always engaged denotes ever  devout  towards
the  Supreme  Lord  being  ever  intent  on  communion  with  Him  which  is
continuing the sentiments of the last verse in chapter 11.  The  words  tvam
paryupasate means direct worship of Lord Krishna and refers to  deeming  the
Supreme Lord as the complete fulfilment of ones every ambition and  desire.
The Supreme Lord, the perfect, infallible one, the  Sovereign  Lord  of  all
creation  and  the  refuge  of  all  cosmic  glories,  possessing  unlimited
attributes of exalted qualities such as divinity,  omniscience,  compassion,
omnipotence, etc.  Such  ones  are  thy  eternal  adorers  and  always  your
beloved.

Those other votaries  are  the  worshippers  of  the  abstract,  impersonal,
avyaktam or unmanifest and imperceptible. which is aksaram or  imperishable.
Such also reflect and contemplate upon the  nature  of  the  pratyagatma  or
individual soul which is imperishable also as well as  being  unmanifest  in
as much as it is indiscernible by the mind and imperceptible to any  of  the
senses such as the eye or ear, etc.

Of these two classes of aspirants which one is superior  and  most  suitable
for  performing  yoga  or  the  science  of  the  individual   consciousness
attaining communion with the ultimate  consciousness.  Inferring  which  one
would achieve their respective  goals most expediently. In verse seven  Lord
Krishna gives the definitive reply in answer to  this  query  by  succinctly
revealing the most expeditious way to attain the ultimate goal.	</p>
