<h2 class="bg-title ec-ssa">English Commentary  - Swami Sivananda </h2>
<p class="bg-desc ec-ssa">16.1 अभयम् fearlessness? सत्त्वसंशुद्धिः purity of heart? ज्ञानयोगव्यवस्थितिः steadfastness in knowledge and Yoga? दानम् atmsgiving? दमः control of the senses? च and? यज्ञः sacrifice? च and? स्वाध्यायः study of Sastras? तपः austerity? आर्जवम् straightforwardness.Commentary The Lord made a mention of the three kinds of Nature that belong to sentient beings? viz.? the nature of the gods? Asuras and Rakshasas? in the ninth discourse (verses 12 and 13). He now describes them in detail in this discourse. The distinction between the god or the godman and the Asuras is clearly drawn in the first? second? third and fourth verses. Daivi Prakriti or the nature of the gods leads to Moksha or release from the round of birth and death. The nature of the Asuras and Rakshasas leads to bondage. This is an obstacle to the attainment of knowledge of the Self. The divine nature must be accepted and cultivated the Asuric and Rakshasic nature should be abandoned. All these alities are found in human beings. There are Sattvic people who possess the divine attributes there are Asuras and Rakshasas among human beings also? who are endowed with demoniacal alities? who are filled with excessive Tamas. In an ordinary man there is a mixture of the three Gunas. Tamas and Rajas pull a man downwards Sattva lifts a man upwards. Tamas and Rajas lead to bondage Sattva helps to attain salvation. Discipline yourself and develop Sattva This is the foundation of Yoga. This is the first preparatory discipline. The first rung in the spiritual ladder is reached by developing Sattva. When the mind is Sattvic? thee is calmness in it. Divine light can descend only when the mind is serene and cheerful.The Sattvic man controls the senses? does selfless service? and practises Japa? Pranayama? concentration? meditation? selfanalysis and eniry of Who am I He is not attracted by sensual objects. He has a burning desire for attaining Moksha. He is humble? generous? merciful? forbearing? tolerant and pious. He destroys his little personality. The Rajasic man is proud? intolearnt? egoistic? selfsufficient? lustful? hottermpered? greedy and jealous. He works for his own glory and fame and selfaggrandisement. he develops his own little vain personality.There is intimate connection between the Gunas and Karmas. The nature of the Karmas depends upon the nature of the Gunas. A Sattvic man will do virtuous actions. A Rajasic and Tamasic man will perform evil actions. It is the Guna that goads a man to do actions. The Self or Brahman is actionless. It is the silent witness.The Lord sums up in the first three verses the alities of a godly man who is inclined to the path of liberation. He then enumerates the alities of the demoniacal man. The theme of this chapter is the tracing of the difference between the divine and the Asuric nature.Virtue and vice are relative terms. The virtue of one period will become the vice of the other. From the transcendental point of view? there is neither virtue nor vice.Why should there be evil How did evil arise -- these are all transcendental estions (Atiprasnas). You can get answers to these estions only when you attain Selfrealisation. People unnecessarily rack their brains to get an answer to these estions. It is a serious mistake.Daivi Sampat (divine wealth or the wealth of divine alities) helps the aspirant to attain knowledge of the Self. The Sattvic or divine attributes such as fearlessness? purity of heart? control of the senses? etc.? constitute Daivi Sampat. They enable the aspirant to attain the highest state of superconsciousness (Nirvikalpa Samadhi) wherein the seer and the seen are united in one? the meditator and the meditated become identical. Divine alities or attributes which go to augment the bliss of the Self? which help the aspirant to attain the happiness of the Self? are called divine,wealth.Among the divine alities? fearlessness stands foremost. Fear is an effect of ignorance. Identification with the body causes fear. Blind attachment to the body? wife? children? house or property is the cause of fear. The sge who has realised the Self is absolutely fearless.He who knows the Bliss of Brahman from which words as well as the mind turn powerless? fears nothing. (Taittiriya Upanishad)Fearlessness is the devout observance of the precepts enjoined in the scriptures without doubting. The state of being free from the fear? How can I live now when I have renounced everything? when I have none to support me is fearlessness. A Sannyasi resolves when he takes Sannyasa? I will not induce fear in any living creature. Keeping up this resolve of Abhaya Dana (gift of the boon of fearlessness to all creatures) in thought? word and deed is Abhayam or fearlessness. Fear can be removed by constant thinking of the immortal and allblissful nature of the Self. If you lead a life of honesty and truthfulness? if you devoutly observe the precepts of the scriptures without doubting? if you lead a life of right conduct? and if you remember God always? you will become fearless. When one beholds the Self only everywhere? when the sense of duality has vanished? when the sense of unity has dawned in him? how can he be afraid of anything? how can the feeling of fear arise in him Fearlessness is essential for the attainment of Moksha or salvation. Fearlessness is the chief characteristic of a liberated sage. It is the one accurate measure of ones spiritual progress. It is the cardinal virtue of an illumined sage. That is the reason why it is placed in the forefront of all divine alities. Only a liberated sage can be absolutely fearless.Sattvic Subha Vasana (good tendency) is Daivi Sampat. It induces a man to practise discrimination? dispassion? control of the mind and the senses? etc.? which help him to attain knowledge of the Self. The Rajasic and the Tamasic (Asubha or evil) Vasnas (tendencies) which operate along the currents of RagaDvesha (likes and dislikes)? which induce one to perform actions which are prohibited by the scriptures and which produce disastrous effects? constitute demoniacal nature.In Asuric nature inclination towards sensual pleasures is predominant in Rakshasic nature hatred predominates and the Rakshasa does various sorts of harm and injury to others.Good tendencies lead to Moksha. Evil tendencies lead to bondage. Good tendencies must be cultivated. Evil tendencies should be eradicated. You shoul first have a knowledge of the essential nature of these two Vasanas? if you wish to cultivate the good tendencies and eradicate the evil ones. This sixteenth discourse gives a vivid description of these tendencies.Sattvasamsuddhih Purity of understanding? cleanliness of life or purity of heart. Purity of mind? i.e.? giving up of cheating? hypocrisy? untruth and the like? in all dealings with the people? and doing transactions with perfect honesty and integrity is Sattvasamsuddhi.When the understanding abides constantly in the immortal Self and is thus firm and steadfast? you may know this to be a condition of purity. On account of purity the mind can know the Self. The state of the mind wherein it is free from doubts like Asambhavana (thought of improbability of the existence of the Self)? etc.? through hearing of the scriptures is Sattvasamsuddhi. As purity of mind cannot be obtained without devotion to the Lord? devotion is implied in these Sattvic virtues.Jnana Knowledge understanding the nature of the Self? as taught in the scriptures and by the preceptor Selfrealisation through meditation on the Great Sentence of the Upanishad. I am Brahman (Aham Brahmasmi)? is Jnana.Yoga is union of the individual soul with the Supreme Being it is the direct realisation of the Self by concentration and meditation? through selfrestraint or control of the senses. The aspirant cognises through direct perception by the inner eye of intuition or wisdom what has been learnt from the scriptures and the preceptor. The aspirant attains Selfrealisation or direct knowledge. He becomes one with Brahman -- the Absolute. He gets indirect knowledge or mere understanding or theoretical knowledge of Brahman from the scriptures. Now through the practice of Yoga he gets direct knowledge. The attempt which is favourable for the annihilation of the mind and the latent tendencies is also known as Yoga.Jnanayogavyavasthitih The state of Jivanmukti attained through Jnana Yoga? which is distinct from the state of the worldlyminded persons.Fearlessness? purity of heart and steadfastness in knowledge and Yoga are the three preeminent virtues amongst the Sattvic attributes enumerated in verses 1 to 3. They are found in Jnana Yogins only. The other alities are common to Jnana Yogins? Karma Yogins? Raja Yogins and Bhaktas. Unless you possess Sattvic virtues? you cannot practise any kind of Yoga. If you cultivate one virtue? all other virtues will cling to you by themselves. Fearlessness is the basis and foundation of the whole of mans moral structure within.Svadhyaya and Tamas constitute Kriya Yoga. Svadhyaya constitutes BrahmaYajna. Almsgiving and sacrifice pertain to Karma Yoga. Almsgiving? selfcontrol and sacrifice constitute Daivi Sampat for householders. Those alities mentioned in chapter XVI? verses 1 to 3? which belong to the aspirant who practises a particular form of Yoga constitute the Daivi Sampat of the disciple on that path.Dana Almsgiving distributing food? clothes? etc.? as far as it iles in ones power? according to ones means. A charitable man hastens to comfort the distressed and helps the needy. Charity is of three kinds? viz.? Sattvic? Rajasic and Tamasic (see chapter XVII? 20 to 22). It opens the gates of heaven. It will bring nearer the means of liberation. Just as the tree gives fruit and shade without distinction? so also give to him who needs? without distinction? with a cheerful heart.Dama Selfrestraint? selfcontrol? control of the external senses. The control of the inner senses or the mind is described in the next verse.The practice of selfcontrol annihilates the union between the senses and the sensual objects. It separates the senses from their respective objects. The aspirant will not allow the wind of the sensual objects to blow through the gateway of his senses. He keeps the senses under the strictest restraint. He lights the fire of dispassion at all the ten gates of the body. He takes rigid vows. He observes Mauna (the vow of silence) and celibacy. He is moderate in his diet. He keeps the golden medium in everything. He checks the outgoing tendencies of the mind and the senses. He induces the mind and the senses to turn backwards towards their source. Just as an enemy is cut down by means of a weapon? so also every tendency towards sensual objects is cut down by the practice of selfcontrol. All internal promptings? cravings and Vasanas should be burnt in the fire of renunciation? at the ten gates of the senses. As householders cannot practise perfect control of the senses? even moderation or regulated and disciplined life will constitute selfrestraint for them. The practice of selfcontrol includes forgiveness? harmlessness? truth? steadiness and,patience.Yajna Sacrifice. The fireworship (Agnihotra) and the like enjoined in the Vedas and also the sacrifice to the gods (DevaYajna) or worship of the gods? PitriYajna? BhutaYajna? ManushyaYajna and BrahmaYajna enjoined in the scriptures (Smritis).Svadhyaya Study of the Vedas in order to attain the unseen fruits.Tapas Austerity? moritification of the body and other forms of penance. True Tapas is meditation on the Self. It is fixing the mind on Brahman or the Self. It is to separate oneself from the physical body and the other four sheaths and to identify oneself with the Absolute. It is to turn the mind towards the soul. The three kinds of Tapas mentioned in chapter XVII? verses 14 to 16 come under this category.Arjavam Straightforwardness. This is conducive to the attainment of knowledge. The aspirant should always be candid? upright or straightforward. Straightforwardness should be his constant attitutde. A just and truthful man alone can be straightforward. He is respected by the people. He is liked by all. He attains success in all his endeavours. He never hides facts or truth.	</p>

<h2 class="bg-title scet-ssa ">English Translation of Ramanuja's Sanskrit Commentary</h2>
<p class="bg-desc scet-ssa ">16.1 The Lord said  Fear is the pain arising from the awareness of the cause which brings about pain in the form of either dissociation from the objects of attainment or association with the objects of aversion. The absence of this is fearlessness. Purity of mind is the condition of Sattva, viz., the state of the internal organ being untouched by Rajas and Tamas. Devotion to meditation on the knowledge (of the self) is firm adherence to the discrimination between the pure nature of the self and Prakrti. Alms-giving is the giving away of ones wealth earned through right means to the deserving. Self-control is the practice of withdrawal of the mind from sense-objects. Worship is the performance of the fivefold duties (sacrifices) etc., of life in the spirit of worship of the Lord without attachment to the fruits. The study of the Vedas is devotion to the Vedic study with the conviction that all the teachings of the Vedas deal with the Lord, with His glorious nature and with the mode of worshipping Him. Austerity is the practice of penances like Krchra, Candrayana, vow on the twelfth day of the lunar fortnight, etc., which foster capability for performing acts pleasing to the Lord. Uprightness consists of the oneness of thought, word and deed in ones dealings with others.	</p>



<h2 class="bg-title chakravarthi">Commentary  - Chakravarthi Ji</h2>
<p class="bg-desc chakravarthi">In the sixteenth chapter, the deva and demon qualities as well as the results of these two conditions will be described.
Remembering that the fruits of the asvattha tree of samsara had not been describe in the last chapter after mentioning them, the Lord in this chapter describes the fruits of the tree which are of two varieties: those which cause liberation and those which cause bondage. First, he describes those giving liberation in three verses.
Abhayam means freedom from the fear of “How will I live being alone in the forest without wife and children?”
Sattva samsuddhih means purity of consciousness. Jnana yoga vyavasthitah means being completely familiar with the methods of attaining jnana, for example lack of pride, mentioned in chapter thirteen. Dana means to distribute food or other items of one’s enjoyment to others. Dama means controlling the external senses. Yajna means worship of the Lord. Svadhyaya means studying or reciting the Vedas. The other items after this are clear. Tyaga means to give up possessiveness of wife, children and other things. Aloluptam means absence of greed.
These twenty six items belong to the person born at a moment indicating sattvika nature.	</p>



<h2 class="bg-title rudra">Rudra Vaishnava Sampradaya - Commentary </h2>
<p class="bg-desc rudra">
In order to discern the reality that jivas  or  embodied  beings  who  fully
renounce demoniac activities and exclusively  engage  in  divine  activities
are awarded moksa or liberation from material existence  and  to  grant  the
ability to clearly distinguish between the two;  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna
describes first the divine qualities and then the demoniac.

At the conclusion of chapter 15 Lord Krishna explained  that  one  realising
the eternal spiritual truths stated their is situated in actual  wisdom  and
accomplished in all duties both eternal and occasional. Now in this  chapter
Lord Krishna is clarifying by qualities exactly who is a recipient  of  this
knowledge and established in wisdom and who is not.  He first describes  the
qualities of those jivas or  embodied  beings  situated  within  the  divine
nature  possessing  divine   qualities   and   then   He   describes   those
jivas situated within the demoniac nature possessing demoniac qualities.  It
is only after the goal of an accomplishment has  been  ascertained  that  an
assessment  of  the  requirements  and  who  is  qualified  for  it  can  be
determined. As the old adage from sage Kumarila Bhatta  has  foretold:  Only
after a load has been weighed can it be determined who is fit to carry it.

So as the goal being the recipient of knowledge  has  been  determined;  the
divine qualities that characterise an aspirant  who  is  qualified  are  now
being enumerated in  these  three  verses  beginning  with  abhayam  meaning
fearlessness, for in knowing one is eternal there  is  nothing  to  ever  be
afraid of. Other qualities are purity of heart, complete serenity  of  mind,
steady absorption in knowledge  of  yoga  or  the  individual  consciousness
attaining communion with the  ultimate  consciousness.  Charity  is  sharing
with others what is valuable to oneself.  Self  control  of  the  mind,  the
senses and the  organs of action. Performing and taking part in  ritualistic
activities which propitiate and glorify the Supreme Lord Krishna or  any  of
His incarnations or expansions which are  authorised  in  Vedic  scriptures.
Receiving instructions from the spiritual master and studying of  the  Vedic
scriptures, singing Vedic hymns,  chanting  repetitively  Vedic  mantras  or
sacred incantations.  Austerity and temperance in the habits and  activities
the physical body engages in. Enacting all activities without  duplicity  or
deception.  The  word  ahimsa  means  abstaining  from  injuring  others  by
thought, word or deed. The one exception to this rule  is  when  ones  life
and dependents are in danger.

Truthfulness is relating the facts as they are and not as one wants them  to
be  perceived.  Absence  of  anger  is  calmness  within  the  mind  without
agitation even when  rebuked,  attacked  or  in  the  process  of  defending
oneself. Tyagah is renunciation of possessions and thus natural  generosity.
Tranquillity is complete control of  the  mind.   Freedom  from  slander  is
absence of envy and  retaliation.  Compassion  is  kindness  to  all  living
beings especially when  they  are  in  distress.  Non-covetousness  is  self
satisfaction with what one has been allotted in life. Gentleness is  absence
of cruelty or harshness. Modesty is shyness  in  decorum  and  hesitancy  in
even the thought of wrong doing. Absence of fickleness is the  avoidance  of
frivolous activities. Boldness is courage in asserting  what  is  truth  and
defending righteousness. Forgiveness is not becoming upset  by  humiliation.
Fortitude is steadying the mind when under great duress. Purity is  external
and internal cleanliness. The lack of conceit  is  absence  of  thinking  of
oneself egotistically. These  26  qualities  related  by  Lord  Krishna  are
characterised  by one  who  is  situated  in  the  divine  nature  and  thus
qualified to attain association with the Supreme Lord and His devotees.	</p>


<h2 class="bg-title brahma">Brahma Vaishnava Sampradaya - Commentary </h2>
<p class="bg-desc brahma">

Hari OM! The Supreme Lord Krishna elaborately  describes  the  qualities  of
the divine  nature  and  then  describes  the  demoniac  nature  to  clearly
distinguish between the  two.   The  meritorious  qualities  of  the  divine
nature which follows the nature of  Brahma  who  as  the  secondary  creator
manifested all creatures is self  evident.  The  emphasis  is  on  the  word
tapasya  meaning  austerity.  Adherence   to   brahminical   qualities   and
attributes is itself an austerity. Ahimsa  is  non-violence  to  any  being.
Animosity is the intent to cause injury to others, it is the defect  pointed
out in rulers and military commanders.  The  Amarakosa  dictionary  mentions
this as well. Kings and emperors ruling without  fear  by  the  strength  of
their might proudly regard all others  as  inferior.  This  is  said  to  be
arrogance. Tyagah is renunciation of possessiveness such as  obsession  with
position, family, wealth, etc. The  word  ksama  meaning  tolerance  is  the
state of mind which forgives  and  refrains  from  harming  those  who  have
caused harm.	</p>


<h2 class="bg-title shri">Shri Vaishnava Sampradaya - Commentary </h2>
<p class="bg-desc shri">
In the previous three chapters the topics  explained  by  the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna were:
1) The essential nature of physical matter and  spirit  as  the  atma  or
immortal soul.
2) The fact that when the atma and physical matter are conjoined it is  a
result due to attachment to the gunas  or  three  modes  of   material
nature and when the atma is independent of matter it is a result   due
to being unattached to the gunas.
3)  That  both  the  atma  and  physical  matter  in  whatever  condition
constitute two distinct aspects of the Supreme Lords potencies.
4) That the Supreme Lord  as  the  source  of  all  that  exists  yet  is
factually distinct and separate from all aspects of His creation  both
achit or matter and chit or spirit which  are  contained  within  Him.
This includes every jiva or  embodied  being  in  all  creation;  both
baddha-jivas who are bound and  mukta-jivas  who  are  liberated.  The
Supreme Lord possesses all transcendental and divine powers  such  as:
immortality,  sovereignty,  omnipotence,  omniscience,  omni-presence,
etc.

Lord Krishna will substantiate the  reality  of  what  has  previously  been
declared in accordance to  the  ordinances  and  injunctions  of  the  Vedic
scriptures which are the absolute authority. This is done  by  initiating  a
comparison between the divine nature  and  the  demoniac  nature  as  it  is
verified  throughout  creation.  The  divine   nature   expresses   complete
allegiance to righteousness and adherence to  the  authority  of  the  Vedic
scriptures. The demoniac nature does not follow righteousness, neither  does
it accept  the  absolute  authority  of  the  Vedic  scriptures;  contrarily
adopting  inauspicious   activities   befitting   impure   concoctions   and
unrighteous conceptions.

Lord Krishna begins by describing the 26 divine qualities:
1) abhayam is fearlessness due to the absence  of  anxiety  which  arises
from the dread of harm to the physical body or the prospect of  losing
what is precious.
2) sattva-samsuddhih is  purification  of  ones  existence  and  denotes
purity of heart consisting of pure goodness undefiled with  the  taint
of passion and ignorance.
3) jnana-yoga-vyavasthitih means situated in the  knowledge  of  devotion
resulting from discriminating the atma or immortal soul from  physical
matter as the individual  consciousness  attains  communion  with  the
ultimate consciousness.
4) danam is  the  charity  given  to  worthy  recipients  from  what  one
legitimately owns.
5) damah is self restraint, controlling the mind to  be  uninfluenced  by
sense objects.
6) yagna is Vedically authorised ritualistic ceremonies  in  propitiation
and  devotion  to  the  Supreme  Lord  Krishna  exclusively  for   His
satisfaction without any self interests.  This  also  applies  to  His
authorised incarnations and expansions.
7) svadhyayah is devoted study of Vedic  scriptures,  knowing  that  they
alone teach the glories of the Supreme Lord and are  the  quintessence
of all that is spiritual.
8) tapas is austerity and penance. Performing expiatory activities  is  a
duty for all human beings such as Ekadasi which is  mandatory  fasting
from all grains on the 11th day of the waxing  and  waning  moons.  As
well there are occasional  expiatory  activities  such  as  candrayana
which are fasts synchronised with the cycles  of  the  moon  and  also
kricchra which is extreme ascetic penance performed under very hot  or
very cold conditions and prajapatya  and  santapana.  Such  activities
purifies an aspirant and prepares and qualifies them for  devotion  to
the Supreme Lord.
9) arjavam is simplicity, straight forwardness to others in thought, word
and deeds.
10) ahimsa is non-violence to all living entities  by  thought,  word  and
deed.
11) satyam is truthfulness verily speaking what is true that is beneficial
to all beings.
12) akrodah is freedom from anger due to absence of resentment for others.
13) tyagah is renunciation of whatever is opposed to atma-tattva  or  soul
realisation. o
14) santih is tranquillity, keeping the senses peaceful and impervious  to
agitation.
15) apaisunam is aversion to fault finding and slandering others  even  if
warranted.
16) daya is mercy, sympathy for life, empathy for the distress and  misery
of others.
17) aloluptvam is absence of greed for sense gratification.
18) mardavam is gentleness and humility which is appropriate  for  saintly
association.
19) hrih is modesty, the feeling of  shame  at  the  thought  of  anything
inappropriate.
20) acapalam is determination to remain firm against temptations presented
to one.
21) tejas is radiance, luster. The illustrious proof of  the  efficacy  of
spiritual practice.
22) ksama is forgiveness. The absence of vengeful feelings  against  those
harmed by.
23) dhritih is fortitude. The capacity for  righteousness  while  enduring
great duress.
24) saucam is cleanliness both internally and externally to be spiritually
worthy.
25) adrohah is absence of  envy,  non-interference  in  the  interests  of
others.
26) natimanita absence of  false  ego,  lack  of  desire  for  honour  and
prestige.

The divine qualities and nature are for those  aspiring  to  activate  their
divinity  following  the  time  tested  eternal,   divine   ordinances   and
injunctions as  revealed  in  the  Vedic  scriptures  by  the  Supreme  Lord
Krishna. Their virtues of these 26 qualities are revealed by following  them
and living them in this manner. The word abhijatasya  refers  to  those  who
were born with the divine nature destined to follow the divine path and  who
are naturally in harmony with divinity.	</p>
